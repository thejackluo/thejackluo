## Hey There!üëã
I am Jack, an ai / full stack developer in the Bay Area, California. Exploring emerging breakthrough technologies has always interested me. I am currently tinkering with large language models and neural networks and exploring neuromorphic computing concepts. As a hobby, I created side projects in hackathons (with a few awards).

Currently, I am developing **Ophelus** and **Calend.ai**, two ambitious projects revolving around personal assistants and schedule automations!
If you have any project ideas or want to discuss emergent technologies, reach out to me below!
