## Hey There!üëã
I'm Jack ‚Äî a passionate AI and full-stack engineer from the Bay Area, constantly exploring the frontiers of technology. My journey in Computer Science fuels my curiosity, especially in the realms of natural language processing and automation.

I'm focused on revolutionizing productivity through [Mira](https://github.com/thejackluo/mira), an AI-driven productivity suite designed to automate and streamline workflows in teams and personal projects. Simultaneously, I am looking into new financial strategies and creative ways to trade in [StockM2](https://github.com/thejackluo/stock-model-v2).

Learning wise, I like to delve into human nature and philosophy. I've dabbled in generative agents, marl (multi agent reinforcement learning), extended reality concepts.

When I'm not coding or ideating, I'm an avid electric unicyclist, a Japanese language enthusiast, and a poker player. I hope to innovate and empower others to do the same.

I'm always open to discussing new project ideas. So, if you're as excited about the future as I am, let's connect and explore what we can build together!
