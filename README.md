# Hey There!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jack, an ai / full stack developer in the Bay Area, California. Exploring emerging breakthrough technologies has always interested me. Right now, I am tinkering with large language models, neural networks, and exploring neuromorphic computing concepts. I created side projects in hackathons (with a few awards) as a hobby.

Currently I am developing **Vigama** and **Elizabeth.ai**, two ambitous projects revolving around personal assistants and improvement!
If you have any project ideas or love AI, reaching out to me below!
