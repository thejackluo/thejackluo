Hello everyone!

My name is Jack and front end developer / entrepreneur residing in the Bay Area, California. I have extensive experience in 2 programming languages: Java, JS, done extensive web development, and is currently developing using the MERN stack. I created projects in and out of hackathons and won awards in a few of them. In my free time, I enjoy composing music, traveling, talking to people, trying out new food, and dwell on logic puzzles. I love to network with new people so feel free to connect!

If you want to talk to me about anything regarding life, starting organization or start ups, or programming experiences. You can schedule a 20 minute meeting below and reach out via email (24 hours ahead of time). Link: https://calendly.com/jackluo
