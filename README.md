## Hey There!üëã
I‚Äôm **Jack Luo**, AI‚Äëcentric full‚Äëstack engineer based in the Bay Area, building agentic systems that plan, communicate, and execute work with minimal human oversight.

My research interests include ultra‚Äëlow‚Äëlatency model serving, voice‚Äënative agents, distributed multi‚Äëagent systems, and the infrastructure that binds modern AI tooling to legacy software.

When I'm not coding, I'm an electric unicyclist with 2500+ miles (sf to ny), poker player seeking positive elixir trades.

I'm always open to discussing new project ideas. So, if you're building the future, let's chat
